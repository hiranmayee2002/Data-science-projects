A CO₂ emissions prediction project in data science involves using historical data and statistical/machine learning techniques to forecast future carbon dioxide emissions. 

This type of project is important for climate research, policymaking, and sustainability efforts.

A CO₂ emissions prediction project uses data to estimate future emissions from sources like transportation, energy production, industry, and agriculture. 

The goal is to understand patterns and predict how much CO₂ will be released under certain conditions.

#Skills Used
1)Data collection and cleaning
2)Data visualization
3)Machine learning / time series forecasting
4)Model evaluation
5)Domain knowledge in environmental science or energy

#Tools and libraries used
Python, Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Statsmodels, Prophet
TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning)
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

#Steps Involved:
1)Define the Problem
Goal: Predict CO₂ emissions in the future (e.g., by year 2030).
2)Collect Data
Use sources like the World Bank or Global Carbon Project for data on emissions, GDP, energy use, population, etc.
3)Preprocess the Data
Clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis.
4)Analyze the Data
Visualize trends and relationships (e.g., GDP vs CO₂).
5)Build a Model
Use models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Time Series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future values.
6)Evaluate the Model
Use metrics like MAE or RMSE to check accuracy.
7)Make Predictions
Forecast future emissions and explore different scenarios (e.g., with or without renewable energy adoption).
8)Visualize Results
Create charts or dashboards to present your findings.

#Outcome:
You get a model that can help predict future CO₂ emissions, useful for governments, researchers, or environmental planning.

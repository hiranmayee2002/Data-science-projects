Anemia is a condition marked by reduced hemoglobin or red blood cell count. Early screening from non-invasive signals (for example, eye-related clinical measurements or image-derived biomarkers) can help with faster triage and referral.
This project uses an eye-condition dataset (tabular features extracted from eye images or clinical notes) to train supervised machine learning models that predict whether a patient is anemic.
Key goals:
.Preprocess and clean the dataset
.Explore correlations and visualize distributions
.Train and evaluate multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, others)
.model predictions using feature importance and SHAP 
.Export the best model for inference
#csv file
Dataset features include:
Eye redness,Eye dryness,conjuctive,pupil size,blink rate,retinal,retinal health,iris colour,Anemia status etc.
#Requirements
.Python 3.8+
#Recommended libraries (see requirements.txt):
.pandas, numpy
.scikit-learn
.matplotlib, seaborn
.xgboost 
#Modeling & Evaluation
.Baseline models to try: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree.
.Stronger models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM).
.Cross-validation: use stratified K-fold (e.g., StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5)) to maintain label balance.
.Class imbalance: if dataset is imbalanced, consider class_weight='balanced', oversampling (SMOTE), or undersampling.
#Metrics to report:
.Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
.ROC AUC (preferred for imbalanced data)
.Confusion matrix
#Feature Engineering & Explainability
.Create domain-specific features (e.g., color channel statistics from image patches, normalized pallor index).
.Used feature selection (recursive feature elimination or tree-based importance).
.For model explainability, include SHAP values or Permutation Importance to show which features drive predictions.
#Ethical Use & Limitations
.Models trained on limited or biased datasets may not generalize across populations. Evaluate on external validation cohorts when possible.
.This project is for research/educational purposes and not a medical diagnostic tool. Any clinical deployment requires regulatory approval and clinical validation.
